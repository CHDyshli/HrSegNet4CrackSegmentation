目前的裂缝检测方法越来越倾向于利用机器学习或者深度学习，因为基于深度学习的方法可以从图像中自主抽取特征，从而避免的人工设计的算子导致的低稳定性。然而，当前的基于深度学习的裂缝分割算法的研究仍然存在一些问题。首先，绝大部分的研究都是基于当前流行的通常场景的分割算法，在这些方法的基础上进行修改、改进，没有针对裂缝分割的任务进行针对性的设计。然后，裂缝检测越来越依赖于边缘设备，例如无人机、车载相机，因此，模型必须保证轻量化以达到实时分割的效率，但是，目前鲜有这方面的研究。在这个研究中，我们提出了带有语义指导的高分辨率神经网络用于实时的裂缝分割，命名为HrSegNet。
The current trend in crack detection methods is leaning towards the use of machine learning or deep learning. This is because deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract features from images, thereby avoiding the low stability caused by manually designed operators. However, there are still some problems with the current deep learning-based crack segmentation algorithms. Firstly, the vast majority of research is based on the modification and improvement of commonly used scene segmentation algorithms, with no specifically designed for crack segmentation tasks. Secondly, crack detection is increasingly reliant on edge devices, such as drones and vehicle-mounted cameras. Therefore, the model must be lightweight to achieve real-time segmentation efficiency. However, there is currently limited research in this area. In this study, we propose a high-resolution neural network with semantic guidance for real-time crack segmentation, named HrSegNet.
